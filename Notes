Ideas:
- Books need attribute for language
- Preference: National or foreign author?
- Age of the reader, ex. if age < 14 => difficulty = easy
- Where to read, ex. if collective transport => difficulty = easy or medium
- How often to read, ex. daily => difficulty = easy or medium
- Genres that are related somehow, ex. magic => sword and sorcery
- If empty (no preferences) => popularity = best sellers
- If empty (no preferences) and if have a friend => use friend's data
- If an experienced reader => difficulty = hard and popularity = critics or classic

Other things:
Does the book "Seven deadly sins" have author?
In the onthology put a constraint => not possible be friend to yourself
The nationality for all authors is not correct.
What can we use with the information "time of the day the reader reads?"
